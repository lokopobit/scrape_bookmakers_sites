# What was going to be this repository?
This repository was intented to:  


1. Scrape bet365 quotes with selenium python library  
2. Process the data with a predefined strategy (dovish or bearish) to choose matches to bet
3. Automatically bet the computed cuantity

The first step was coded in the script bet365_scraper.py 6 months ago. I tested and it worked fine without being blocked, but now firefox driver is blocked by bet365 so it cannot be tested now. You can see how the driver is launched in the functions.py script.  

Note: I will no longer improve this repository until the driver works. I will keep you updated. Text me with news.
