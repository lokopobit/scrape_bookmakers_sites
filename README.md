# What was going to be this repository?
This repository was intented to:  


1. Scrape bet365 quotes with selenium python library  
2. Process the data with a predefined strategy (dovish or bearish) to choose matches to bet
3. Automatically bet the computed cuantity

The first step is coded in the script bet365_scraper.py but I could not tested given that  firefox driver is blocked by bet365. You can see how the driver is launched in the functions.py script.  

Note: I will no longer improve this repository until the driver works.
